# ECON323

This project is meant to  showcase a full data science workflow. From scrapping multiple real-world datsets, cleaning them and carrying out analysis. I will be using 3 datasets :

1. RateMyProf data
2. UBC grades data
3. UBC professor salary data

I will be carrying out a sentiment analysis on the RateMyProf data using Google's BERT to rate induvidual reviews as positive, negative or neutral. Together with the other data I have collected I will run a panel regression to see how professor salary changes as student reviews and grades change.
