# ECON323

This project is meant to  showcase a  data science workflow. From scrapping multiple real-world datsets, cleaning them, carrying out analysis, and modelling. I will be using 3 datasets :

1. RateMyProf data - Student reviews of professors 
2. UBC grades data - Historical grade distributions 
3. UBC professor salary data - Professor pay

I will be carrying out a sentiment analysis on the RateMyProf data using Google's BERT to rate induvidual reviews as positive, negative or neutral. By integrating this with other datasets I will run a panel regression to see how professor salaries change in response to student reviews and grade distributions.
